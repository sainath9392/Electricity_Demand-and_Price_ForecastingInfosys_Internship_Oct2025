# Electricity Demand and Price Forecasting

## Overview

**This project analyzes electricity demand and price trends using various data processing, visualization, and anomaly detection techniques. The dataset includes features such as temperature, solar exposure, rainfall, holidays, and school days to understand their impact on electricity consumption and pricing.**

## Features

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

### 1.Histograms, box plots, and KDE plots for demand, price, and weather variables.

### 2.Time series analysis of daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly demand variations.

### 3.Anomaly Detection:

### 4.Z-score method to highlight abnormal demand patterns.

### 5.Visualization of detected anomalies in electricity demand.

### 6.Weather Impact Analysis:

### 7.Correlation heatmaps between demand and weather factors.

### 9.Regression plots showing relationships between demand and temperature, solar exposure, and rainfall.

## Price Analysis:

### 1.Identification of negative RRP (Regional Reference Price) periods.

### 2.Trends in electricity prices over time.

### 3.Impact of Holidays & School Days:

### 4.Box plots comparing electricity demand on holidays vs. non-holidays.

### 5.Analysis of school day impact on demand.

## installation

**To run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:**

```python
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## **Usage**

### Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to:

### Clean and preprocess the dataset.

### Generate visualizations for demand and price analysis.

### Detect anomalies and explore demand trends.

## Results

### Seasonal trends in electricity demand.

### High demand periods aligning with specific weather conditions.

### Anomalies in demand and price spikes.
